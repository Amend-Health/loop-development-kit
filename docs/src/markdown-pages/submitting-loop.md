# Submit Your Loop

1. Install the most recent version of the Olive Helps app from the Developer Hub; we've been busy updating the app and updating should preclude any compatibility issues.
2. Package your Loop into Windows and Mac executables, named `olive-helps-loop.exe` and `olive-helps-loop` respectively (without the quotation marks). We recommend using the pkg library for NPM.
3. Place each executable into a directory by itself. The directory should otherwise be empty, as the app will zip and upload the entire contents of that directory.
4. In the Olive Helps sidebar, open the Loop Library. Your account must have developer access enabled, and you should see the Loop Authors section at the bottom left of the window.
5. Click on the Publish New Loop entry in the Loop Authors section.
6. Select the appropriate Operating System's choice.
7. Fill in the fields. The Loop Logo is displayed in the Loop Library, the Whisper Logo is displayed in the top left corner of each Whisper. For the Windows and Mac Directory fields, select the directories you used in step 3.
8. Click Publish!
