   - License Agreement (can be a link to an external resource)
   - Privacy Policy (can be a link to an external resource)
      - Olive Helps requires all third party Loops be HIPAA compliant.

Please include how your Loop meets HIPAA compliance requirements in your Terms of Service / Privacy Policy.
   - Declare what Aptitudes your loop uses from the LDK
   - Describe how your Loop uses the user’s information and how your organization uses that information
   - Declare where your loop is sending users’ information to the subdomain level
   - Include updated contact information for a user to reach out in the event they need help with your loop

1. Test your Loop for crashes and bugs

1. **Whisper, don’t shout**: Rely on the merits of your content, not on loud graphics
1. **Know your audience**: They are experts in their field, treat them as such
1. **Represent your brand**: Use colors, graphic elements and language that has been established for your brand
1. **Don’t betray our users’ trust**: Use data and Aptitudes to deliver valuable information and insights to our users
1. **Overdeliver and delight**: Olive Helps pushes the boundaries of what’s possible
1. **Be original**: Add unique value to the Library
