## Launch the installer (normal)
Most users will be able to install Olive Helps simply by clicking on the downloaded installer. However, if you find that you need to run the installer as an admin, you can follow these steps.

## Launch the installer (if you require admin access to install)
In some environments, you will need to run the installer as an administrator. This process shows how to do that and assumes that you have administrator rights. If you do not have administrator rights and you are not allowed or able to install using the normal mode above, then you will need to work with your IT administrator to have Olive Helps installed.

### Launch powershell as an administrator
Search for powershell in the start menu, then right-click and choose “run as administrator”. You will be prompted for an administrator password.
