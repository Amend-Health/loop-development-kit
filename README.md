# Loop Development Kit

This is the central repository for all the Olive Help LDKs. Please see the individual LDK readmes in the `ldk\{language}` folder.

> **PLEASE NOTE**: In order to provide a highly controlled and secure environment for our Loops, we will be transitioning to a JavaScript-only model and removing support for the C# and Go LDKs. This will also enable us to build additional features and Aptitudes more quickly. Please feel free to reach out to your Olive Helps developer contact if you have any questions.
