# Welcome!

### Olive Helps

Welcome to Olive Helps, healthcare's sidekick. Helps is a lightweight desktop application that gives healthcare workers the information they need,  right when they need it. The platform reduces human errors, improves efficiency, and improves decisions.  And the best part? You can help us develop it and make it even better.

### **Loops**

Loops are mini applications that run on our pre-built platform. They can be created by anyone. Have a problem that needs to solving? Write a loop to do it for you. Think other people could use your loop? Publish it. With our Loop Development Kit, you take the power of Olive into your own hands. To get started, download our platform today!  The included guides will walk you through our kit, and keep you up to date with everything loop related.
