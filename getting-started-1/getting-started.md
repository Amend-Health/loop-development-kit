And congrats! You've officially signed up to become a Loop author. The next thing you'll want to do is to install a Loop locally. Some examples have been included in the LDK for you to use.

1. Download the LDK from [our Github](https://github.com/open-olive/loop-development-kit). Alternatively, you could copy one of the example Loop directories
   * These are located within the LDK at `ldk/javascript/examples`
2. Build your local Loop. See [these instructions](https://github.com/open-olive/loop-development-kit/tree/main/ldk/javascript#producing-loop-compilations) for more information.
3. Run Olive Helps, and then go to the **Loop Library**
4. Click on **Local Loops**
5. Click **Install Local Loop**
6. Select the directory that your compiled code has been output to. If you're using the default configuration, that location will be `$PROJECT_LOCATION/dist`.
7. Configure the information about your local Loop, and click **Install Local Loop**. If everything goes well, you will get a notification that it succeeded.
   * For example, if your local Loop is in the directory `dist/loop.js` you would select `dist`
8. Test out the Loop, and then make some changes.
